    "## WHAT IS ERC20? \n",
    "\n",
    "ERC20 is one of the most important ethereum tokens. ERC20 is nothing but the technical standard set for every token backed by an ethereum network. It is required for all the smart contracts used on the ethereum blockchain. It is essential for the implementation of the Ethereum tokens since it defines the set of rules for all these tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "ERC20 tokens are blockchain technology-based assets that have a certain value and can be received or sent. The only difference is that these tokens do not have their blockchain technology and run on the Ethereum network. These tokens are very similar to Bitcoin, litecoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "New investors and crypto enthusiasts often confuse ether and ERC20. However, they are completely different entities. While Ether is the native token of the ethereum blockchain, ERC20 is the set of standards on which the ethereum blockchain runs. This standard can be used by others to create other tokens like ether having their value. \n",
    "\n",
    "This token standard is specific to fungible tokens. ERC20 does not offer standards for non-fungible tokens. Therefore, only ERC20 tokens can be exchanged with one another. The smart contracts backed by these standards are used to initiate the payment. "

    "ERC20 is neither software, a solution or code. It is a standard protocol, just like HTTP. It governs the tokenization and ensures that the technical specification of the tokens is meet. If a token doesn’t meet standardization, it won’t be called an ERC20 token. If it does, it can be termed as “ERC20 token.”"

    "⚠️  Low throughput - The Ethereum network has been clogged up when dapps have experienced high demand, such as CryptoKitties (which has since moved to its own Flow blockchain). When this happens, the network slows down and transactions become more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "🐢  Slow transactions - The block time is around 14 seconds, so transactions can take up to a minute to process. This may be adequate for some uses or too slow for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "⏲️  ETH - When transactions are made involving ERC-20 tokens, a second cryptocurrency is needed to pay for the transaction fees. This can add both time and cost, as it can result in dust on different platforms."
