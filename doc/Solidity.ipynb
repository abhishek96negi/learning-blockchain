    "## What is Solidity ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts. Solidity is highly influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and has been designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Solidity to create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Written in .sol files\n",
    "2. Strongly typed\n",
    "3. Similar to JavaScript\n",
    "4. Has several huge, gigantic 'gotchas'\n",

    "The line uintstoredData declares a state variable called storedData of type uint and the functions set and get can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.\n",

    "### Function Definition\n",
