    "# What is ERC1155? \n",
    "\n",
    "ERC1155 is a multi-token standard that allows the creation of fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens all in one contract. Before ERC1155, if a use case needed both ERC20 (fungible) and ERC721 (non-fungible) tokens, then separate contracts were required to achieve this. ERC1155 also allows for multiple NFT collections to be launched in just one smart contract instead of creating a different contract for each collection; this increases efficiency in smart contract construction and minimizes the transaction count, which is very important as it consumes less blockchain space. With ERC1155, batch transfer of tokens is also possible instead of transferring a token to a single address in previous standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prevalent example of the ERC1155 application is blockchain-based decentralized games, as games need coins and collectibles, so ERC1155 has become a standard there. ERC1155 has also become a standard in the NFT space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous ERC721 had a one-to-one mapping of token id with the address. ERC1155 has a rather complex mapping where the address in a combination of token id is mapped to the balance of the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERC1155 is a novel token standard that aims to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERC1155 is more than just an NFT token standard. It sets the stage for multi-token management and transactions. With ERC1155, single deployed contracts can include varied combinations of non-fungible, fungible, and semi-fungible tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Originated by the Enjin team, this ERC1155 token standard drew ideas from token standards like ERC20 and ERC721 token. It also introduced improvements of its own. Previously, under ERC-20 or ERC-721, you had to deploy a separate contract for each fungible or non-fungible token. This causes Ethereum’s blockchain to be riddled with redundant bytecode. Also, by separating each contract into individual addresses, the older standards limited certain functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "The token ERC-1155, is a new type of standard token within Ethereum with the ability to change the landscape of DApps within this blockchain, thanks to its multi-token capacity and a new number of functions designed to provide a better user and programming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the standards ERC-20 and ERC-721 Of which we have already discussed, ERC-1155 is a basic formulation designed to create useful tokens that make life easier for developers, all while offering them a powerful and dynamic tool to work with."

    "\n",
    "**The ERC-1155 token is a type of standard token that has the ability to store, under its control, tokens that can act as if they were a token. ERC-20 or ERC-721, or both at the same time under the same address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple and seeks to create a smart contract interface that can represent and control any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. In this way, the ERC-1155 token can do the same functions as an ERC-20 and ERC-721 token, and even both at the same time. And best of all, improving the functionality of both standards, making it more efficient, and correcting obvious implementation errors on the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.**This standard was developed by Witek Radomski, Andrew Cooke, Philippe Castonguay, James Therien, Eric Binet, and Ronan Sandford.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERC-1155 token is described fully in EIP-1155.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinctive feature of ERC1155 is that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once. This is why its balanceOf function differs from ERC20’s and ERC777’s: it has an additional id argument for the identifier of the token that you want to query the balance of.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how ERC721 does things, but in that standard a token id has no concept of balance: each token is non-fungible and exists or doesn’t. The ERC721 balanceOf function refers to how many different tokens an account has, not how many of each. On the other hand, in ERC1155 accounts have a distinct balance for each token id, and non-fungible tokens are implemented by simply minting a single one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leads to massive gas savings for projects that require multiple tokens. Instead of deploying a new contract for each token type, a single ERC1155 token contract can hold the entire system state, reducing deployment costs and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERC-1155 token is fully described in a EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), more specifically in the EIP-1155, from which it derives its name."

    "The ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (for non-fungible, NFT) tokens of Ethereum are widely used within the ecosystem. Just take a look at Etherscan to see the enormous number of tokens of this type that exist. However, both tokens have limitations, some of them quite severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the ERC-20 token, a major limitation of it is the lack of a way to “react” to ERC-20 transfer events. This results in ERC-20 tokens being trapped forever in contracts when users accidentally sent tokens to the wrong address. In this way, if you transfer to an incorrect ERC-20 address, what you have transferred is lost forever."

    "## The limitations of the ERC-721 token\n",
    "For their part, ERC-721 tokens also have their own limitations. For example, obtaining a token identifier directly is impossible, and this makes transactions with these tokens difficult. In fact, if, for example, you have a set of 10 NFTs that you want to transfer to another person, that transfer will require you to carry out 10 different transactions, with their corresponding commission charge and that greatly increases the cost of this simple operation, as well as the load operations of the network, having a tremendous impact on the usability of the Ethereum network. In these scenarios you will have to transfer token by token, being impossible to transfer all 10 at the same time, something quite absurd actually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is traversing the ERC-721 tokens. This requires that all tokens within the contract be traversed for the purposes of providing a response to the DApp and the user in question. Imagine for a moment that an ERC-721 contract has under its registration 1 million tokens, that means that, if a person wants to know the status of their tokens, they must send a transaction to the network which will go through this million tokens, it will match them with the user's addresses and then deliver the response. That is the greatest demonstration of inefficiency that can be had in a system of this type."

    "Along with this, the ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are incompatible with each other. In fact, the contracts are so different that creating additional functionality that links the two is a daunting task, and would likely have a heavy impact on the network, potential failures, and high commission costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important because many DApps make use of both types of tokens, and due to this limitation, the logic of their operation becomes more complex. If a single smart contract could be used to handle everything, it would be much easier to program, as well as being more secure and less complex to design."

Not only that, this solution would even avoid the enormous fragmentation of tokens that exists today, allowing the same type of contract to control both types of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, for example, would allow a DApp developer to use the ERC-1155 so that its users can register fungible tokens (tokens that can be used as payment currencies) and non-fungible tokens (collectibles, exchangeable items within the DApp or game) using the same contract, the same address and simplifying the logic of the DApps and the smart contracts associates. Without a doubt, it is a more efficient use of resources, something that would not come more in blockchains like Ethereum and its limited resources."

    "## New functions and possibilities of the ERC-1155 token\n",
    "A moment ago we talked about the ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens having limitations to be overcome and that ERC-1155 was the answer to it. At this point you will wonder What can you really do with an ERC-1155? Well, these are some of the possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mass transfers as standard\n",
    "The ERC-1155 standard allows to make massive transfers natively of the tokens included in a smart contract. In this way, if, for example, we have a series of NFT tokens or fungible tokens (or both), we can transfer several of these tokens in the same operation, making a single operation make this transfer effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, it is possible to save on transaction costs, minimize the impact on the network, and enable a trading system (escrow/atomic swap) using said tokens much more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple tokens in the same contract\n",
    "In addition to this, an ERC-1155 can describe the existence and operation of multiple tokens at the same time. That is, an ERC-1155 can create one or more fungible tokens (like ERC-20) and can also describe one or more non-fungible tokens (like ERC-721) all within the same contract, facilitating deployment and programming. thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated token type detection\n",
    "Another functionality within the ERC-1155 token is the ability to integrate the functionality of the ERC-165 (known as, Standard Detection Interface), all within the same system. In this way, the ERC-1155 token is able to detect the interface of the token and adapt its behavior depending on it. This is especially useful due to the multitoken nature of the ERC-1155 and simplifies application design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secure token transfer\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most promising features of the ERC-1155 token is the secure token transfer. To do this, the ERC-1155 standard smart contract includes a function that verifies that the transaction has been carried out, and if not, reverts it to return control of the tokens to its issuer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful when we make a mistake in the transcription or copy of addresses and instead send our tokens to the wrong address unable to process our transaction. In that case, the transfer is void, and the issuer recovers the tokens, allowing it to verify the address again and retry the operation. To avoid attacks from double-spending, there are a number of rules described that prevent this behavior, making it safe against these types of attacks and other traps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current use of ERC-1155 tokens\n",
    "Currently there are few platforms that make active use of ERC-1155 tokens, one of them being the game producer Enjin, known for building the Minecraft game. In fact, Enjin is one of the companies that most means has put to promote the use of this new standard, something logical, considering that he has been one of the creators of this new system, by the hand of developer Witek Radomski.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjin has demonstrated the power of this new token by creating a vast number of games that are powered by its Enjin Coin (an ERC-20 token), which is linked to a series of smart contracts that game developers send to ENJ. to create new and unique ERC-1155 fungible or non-fungible tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, or exchanged for your ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, making it scarcer. The result, its ecosystem has grown significantly and, in fact, the ENJ token is positioned as one of the fastest growing tokens this 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility and technical superiority of ERC-1155 seems to be enormous when compared to ERC-20 and ERC-721, making it clear that little by little it will take on more and more spaces. You can see the progress of projects that use ERC-1155 in this websiteIt is only a matter of time that we see more and more projects using this technology."

    "* ERC-721 - This is the token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each token is unique and has its own code, which has led to a burgeoning market for crypto collectibles including trading cards and digital artworks.\n",
    "* ERC-1400 - These are for security tokens so the tokens can be sold as securities. This requires more control over who can access the coins and introduces know-your-customer protocols.\n",
    "* ERC-223 - When you make a transaction, fees are currently paid in Ether. This standard allows for the transaction fees to be paid using the tokens involved. This means a transfer of Augur would be paid in Augur tokens, with the ticker symbol REP.\n",
    "* ERC-777 - It aims to be an improvement on the ERC-20 standard by lowering overheads and adding new features. It is backwards-compatible, which means it might be more widely adopted."
